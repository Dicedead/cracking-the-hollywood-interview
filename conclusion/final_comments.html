    <p><span>Making a successful movie is a complex process that involves many different factors. We summarize in these
            final comments some key observations that can help you create a successful movie.</span></p>
    <p><span>The USA have well-established film industries with a wealth of experience and resources making it a good
            destination for movie production. However, there exists other destinations which can achieve higher mean
            rating and revenue. These two metrics are highly sensible to fluctuations in genre as well, as very similar
            genres may lead to drastically different means. Regarding the cast, the gender and age are generally not
            deterministic factors for the movie success despite the small differences we noticed in our analysis.
            However, we have identified the presence of actor groups that perform well together, which can be helpful
            for future works.</span></p>
    <p><span>Although we have presented some criteria that have previously led to successful movies, we are aware that
            there is no strict rule on how to choose the different components of a film. Sometimes, factors such as an
            economic crisis can lead to significantly lower box office revenues, or even an altercation between actors
            during the film shooting can be the cause of disastrous performances and hence low ratings. We keep in mind
            these limitations in our study, but we also see them as an opportunity to guarantee creativity in cinema,
            well-known as “the seventh art”.</span></p>
